# Research Checklist

Follow these steps before trusting this skill:

1. Identify the freshness risk (APIs, frameworks, standards, or safety-critical topics).
2. Run targeted web searches (official docs, release notes, expert articles) dated 2025 or newer.
3. Record each source with title, URL, and access date in this module and in `metadata.sources`.
4. Validate the legacy guidance inside [core-guidance.md](core-guidance.md) against the new sources.
5. Update `metadata.last_validated`, `metadata.confidence`, and cite the confirmed material.
6. Move confirmed instructions into dedicated topic modules and mark obsolete content for removal.
7. Document remaining unknowns in [known-gaps.md](known-gaps.md).

> Tip: Use `adn_skills("distill_from_wikipedia", ...)`, `adn_skills("distill_from_arxiv", ...)`, and trusted web research to bootstrap validation.
